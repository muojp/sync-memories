# sync-memories: Transfer your camera photos to Android devices via USB rapidly

Got tired of spending time transferring GBs of photo files from your cameras to your phones/tablets via Wi-Fi? Try sync-memories to leverage your device's USB capability.

## Features

 * Direct transfer via USB
   * Normally, 3-4 times FASTER than Wi-Fi
   * Doesn't block device (phone/tablet) Wi-Fi
 * Skip synched files
   * Avoid redundant copying based on file size so corrupt (incomplete) files are re-transfered on the next sync
 * RAW image files (.ARW) supported
   * RAW files can be stored into separate directory so you can easily handle your backup preferences
     * e.g. send JPEG to Google Photos and send JPEG+RAW to Amazon Prime Photos

## How to use

 * Build the app (optional)
 * Install the app
 * Configure source / destination directories
 * Connect your memory card to the device via USB
 * Done

## Binary distribution

sync-memories is a free software, which means you can grab source code, inspect it, build it, and use it (of course, you can also modify and send merge-request) with very few restrictions. Still, there might be some situations when you find binary distribution is useful.

Because the author of this software currently is not motivated to maintain the software on Google Play, there is no general Google Play link. Instead, sync-memories is distributed on F-Droid (planned) and Google Play beta program.

 * [install from Google Play (beta access)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.muo.syncmemories)
 * [install from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/jp.muo.syncmemories/)
