Got tired of spending time transferring GBs of photo files from your cameras to your phones/tablets via Wi-Fi? Try sync-memories to leverage your deviceâ€™s USB capability.

 * Direct transfer via USB
 * Normally, 3-4 times FASTER than Wi-Fi
 * Doesn't block device (phone/tablet) Wi-Fi
 * Skip synched files
 * Avoid redundant copying based on file size so corrupt (incomplete) files are re-transfered on the next sync
 * RAW image files (.ARW) supported
 * RAW files can be stored into separate directory so you can easily handle your backup preferences
 * e.g. send JPEG to Google Photos and send JPEG+RAW to Amazon Prime Photos
